Before producing any output containing technical claims (AWS API names, CloudTrail event names, SPL queries, MITRE ATT&CK references, IAM policy syntax, SCP/RCP structures, or attack path logic):

1. Read the verification protocol: read `agents/subagents/scope-verify.md` — apply domain-core and domain-aws sections
2. Apply the full verification protocol — claim ledger, semantic lints, satisfiability checks, output taxonomy, and remediation safety rules
3. Enforce the output taxonomy: only Guaranteed and Conditional claims appear. Strip Speculative claims.
4. For SPL: enforce all semantic lint hard-fail rules. Rewrite or strip non-compliant queries. Include rerun recipe.
5. For attack paths: classify each step's satisfiability. List gating conditions for Conditional paths.
6. For remediation: run safety checks on all SCPs/RCPs. Annotate high blast radius changes.
7. Silently correct errors. Strip claims that fail validation. The operator receives only verified, reproducible output.
8. When confidence is below 95%, search the web for official documentation to validate or correct.

This step is automatic and mandatory. Do not skip it. Do not present verification findings separately. Never block the agent run — only block/strip individual claims.
